I’m running 4K every other day now. I even did 5K about three times. I’ve reached a point where I don’t suffer at a slow pace. What’s more, I actually look forward to training in advance. Quite a big change compared to December when I was just struggling with myself. I know it’s still not a great athletic achievement. And some people might find these performances laughable (including my younger, more arrogant self). But I don’t mind. You have to start somewhere, right?
