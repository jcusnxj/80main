I managed to stretch my distances a bit and run more or less regularly. I only skipped once when I swapped my run for a few Belgian beers while enjoying the late afternoon sun in Bruges. I can now comfortably handle 4 kilometers (meaning on flat terrain and at a slow pace). I also didnâ€™t smoke for almost the entire month, which helped significantly.
