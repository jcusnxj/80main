The plan was to go for a run every third day — 2 to 3 kilometers each time. In the end, I missed one session. I can’t say I really enjoyed any of those runs. Despite being so short, I struggled most of the time. But that doesn’t surprise me — I’m an overweight smoker. I hope it will get better as long as I keep going regularly.
